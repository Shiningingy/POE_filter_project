## Acknowledgements

This project utilizes data, filter files, and visual assets obtained from [FilterBlade](https://filterblade.xyz/). We gratefully acknowledge their work in the Path of Exile community.

The following files are sourced from FilterBlade:

- `BaseTypes.csv`
- `bonusItemInfo.json`
- `FilterBlade_*.filter` files
- Visual assets: `item_bg` images and `MiniMapIcon_FullSpriteV2.png`

We also use [poe-dat-viewer](https://github.com/SnosMe/poe-dat-viewer) to extract and process information from the game's GGPK files. Many thanks to the authors for this valuable tool.
